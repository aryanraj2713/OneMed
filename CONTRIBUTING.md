## OneMed Contribution Guidelines - MozoHack 2024 (Team 200 OK)

**Welcome Hackers!**

This is Team 200 OK, and we're developing OneMed for MozoHack 2024 organized by SRMKZILLA!  These guidelines will help you contribute to our project after the hackathon concludes. We plan to keep the codebase open source, so your contributions can make a lasting impact. 

**Important Note:**

* The OneMed codebase won't be publicly available until after MozoHack 2024 wraps up. 

**How You Can Contribute**

Once the codebase goes live, here's how you can get involved:

* **Bug Reports:** Encountered a bug after the hackathon? Report it on the issue tracker (details to be provided later).  Describe the bug, steps to reproduce, and expected behavior. 
* **Feature Requests:** Do you have an idea to improve OneMed? Share it! Clearly explain the functionality and the problem it solves.
* **Code Contributions:**  We welcome pull requests that fix bugs, enhance existing features, or introduce new functionalities. 

**Contribution Process**

We'll follow a standard pull request process after the hackathon:

1. **Fork the Repository:**  We'll make the OneMed repository public on a platform like GitHub. You can then fork it to your account.
2. **Create a Branch:**  Develop your improvements in a new branch on your forked repository.
3. **Write Clear Commit Messages:**  Use descriptive commit messages explaining your changes.
4. **Adhere to Coding Conventions (To be Defined):**  We'll define coding conventions (e.g., indentation, naming) after the hackathon. 
5. **Test Your Changes:**  Write unit tests (if applicable) to verify your code works as expected.
6. **Submit a Pull Request:**  Push your changes to your forked branch and submit a pull request to the main repository. 

**Review Process**

We'll review your pull request carefully. This may involve discussions, suggestions for improvements, and potential requests for changes. We appreciate your patience and willingness to collaborate. 

**Additional Points**

* **Professional Tone:** Maintain a professional and respectful tone during interactions with Team 200 OK and the community.
* **Code Quality:**  Strive for clean, well-documented, and efficient code.
* **Licensing:**  All contributions must be submitted under the project's open-source license (to be specified later).
* **Originality:**  Team 200 OK claims ownership of the initial codebase created during MozoHack 2024. However, we highly value your contributions and will give due credit for your work included in the final open-source project. 

#Thank You!

We sincerely appreciate your interest in contributing to OneMed! By following these guidelines, you'll help us make this project even better and contribute to the open-source community.
